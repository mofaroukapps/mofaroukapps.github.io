## Hello and Welcome 

I wanted to create an online content using markdown and I found GitHub Pages is suitable for this purpose. 

It takes me sometime to figure out how to install Jekyll on windows and connect it to GitHup pgaes. Finally I'm online. 
Hope you will find this website useful.

So what will be the topics that I will write about?

You can check them in the [topics page](/topics)

The proposed descriptor is used to match objects under rigid transformations including uniform scaling. The descriptor represents the object by dividing it into shells, acquiring the area distribution of the object through those shells. The computed areas are normalised to make the descriptor scale-invariant in addition to rotation and translation invariant. The effectiveness and stability of the proposed descriptor to noise and variant sampling density as well as the effectiveness of the similarity measures are analysed and demonstrated through experimental results. |
