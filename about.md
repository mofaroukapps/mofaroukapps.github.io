## Hello and Welcome 

I wanted to create an online content using markdown and I found GitHub Pages is suitable for this purpose. 

It takes me sometime to figure out how to install Jekyll on windows and connect it to GitHup pgaes. Finally I'm online. 
Hope you will find this website useful.

So what will be the topics that I will write about?

You can check them in the [topics page](/topics)
